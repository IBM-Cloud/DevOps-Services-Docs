# Source control in Bluemix DevOps Services

###### Last updated: 12 August 2015


In your IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; DevOps Services project, you can use one of three source control systems: a GitHub repository, a Git repo that is hosted on IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade;, or a Jazz source control management (SCM) repo that is hosted on Bluemix. You select a source control system when you create your project.

## GitHub
You can either create a GitHub repo or link to a repo. For more details, 
 see these topics:

* [Git source control](/docs/git)
* [Linking work items in Bluemix DevOps Services to commits in GitHub](/docs/githubhooks)

## Git
If you decide to use Git for source control management, you create a Git repo that is hosted on Bluemix. You can also host a local Git repo. To do so, create your DevOps Services project, and then force push your local repo to the new hosted repo. For more information, see these topics:

* [Git source control](/docs/git)
* [Setting up local clients to work with Git source control](/docs/gitclient)

## Jazz SCM
Jazz SCM works well with Eclipse and IBM Rational Team Concert&trade;. For information about using Jazz SCM hosted on Bluemix, [see Setting up local Eclipse clients to work with Jazz SCM](/docs/jazz_scm_client).
