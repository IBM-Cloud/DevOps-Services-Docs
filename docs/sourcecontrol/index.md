# Source control in Bluemix DevOps Services

###### Last updated: 25 August 2015

For your project's repository, you can choose one of three source control systems: a GitHub repo, a Git repo that is hosted on IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade;, or a Jazz source control management (SCM) repo that is hosted on Bluemix. You select a source control system when you create your project. You can connect to a repo that you already use, or create a repo.

## GitHub
You can store your source code on this popular Git hosting service and use IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; DevOps Services to develop and deploy your app to Bluemix. To learn more, [see the GitHub website](https://github.com/features).

If you want to store your code in a GitHub repo, you must have a GitHub account and give Bluemix access to your GitHub account. When you create a project, you can either create a GitHub repo or link to a repo that you already use. For more details, see these topics:

* [Setting up GitHub for Bluemix DevOps Services projects](/docs/githubhooks)
* [Git source control](/docs/git)

## Git

You can create a Git repo that is hosted on Bluemix or you can host a local Git repo. The repo can be public or private. You control access to it by adding members to your DevOps Services project.

If you want to store your source code in a Git repo, create your DevOps Services project and then force push your local repo to the new hosted repo. For more information, see these topics:
